Fork from apache common bcel 6.0-SNAPSHOT project. Since nobody is maintaining BCEL project so far, and
Lifecycle
AOP project depends on BCEL 6.0 apis, so iMadz releases net.imadz version BCEL 6.0 internally.

DO NOT USE it unless you tested all the 6.0 related apis you need. net.imadz will not be responsible for
maintaining this library.
